# Advanced Database 2022 Project
## Europe Covid 19 cases

The topic presented by us is the analysis of the coronavirus pandemic that occurred worldwide from early 2020 up to mid 2022. Information concerns mostly deaths and cases for European countries. 

We present the data in various forms like tables, histograms and pie charts, and give insight to different aspects of it. Each cell has a header describing shortly its contents. 

After presenting the overview of data, we apply up to 5 filters to get desired results. Filters consist of simple operations like getting the values greater than a certain number, as well as more complex, like calculating the percentage of infected people in a given country.
